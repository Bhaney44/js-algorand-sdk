**Choice Connect Overview**

Choice Connect allows a user to:

1. Click a connect address button to recieve a QR code to scan and connect their address.
2. Click a send asset button to send an asset to a specified address with the Algorand JavaScript-SDK.
3. Click a disconnect address button to disconnect their address.

**Problem**

A major problem on the Algorand blockchain is the lack of scalable and secure open source code for connecting the Algorand Wallet to decentralized applications. The problem with the existing solutions is that they use too much unnecessary code, which creates security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the existing convoluted solutions are difficult to use for open source development because the complexities create difficulty for developers.

**Solution**

Choice Connect provides a minimum example to allow developers to easily create applications with wallet connect, wallet disconnect, and asset send functionality. This solution is for React applications and the Algorand JavaScript-SDK. The purpose for this project is to develop a simplified and scalable methodology for developing wallet connection mechanisms with Algorand applications.
